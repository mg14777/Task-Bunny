# TaskBunny

Tasks Web Application Project for CS2102 Group 16

For this group project, our team was assigned to complete a TaskRabbit clone, which we named TaskBunny. In the application, users could add a task to be matched with another user, update their posted task, assign themselves to a task to do, and use search functions to look through the tasks. Admins could edit and delete tasks as well as using regular user functions, as well as having access to some basic statistics. Each task is assigned to a task category, where details such as salary, location, dates, and a description are present. In the backend of the application, we used Apache as the web server, while also using Php and Postgres as the server page language and database management systems, respectively. The frontend was done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
